            <Synopsis>In September 1996, Brock Lovett was the coordinator of a team that meticulously searched the wreck of the Titanic, a giant, unsinkable liner that nevertheless knew a tragic fate. During a miniature submarine dive, he hopes to finally get his hands on the Heart of the Ocean, a unique jewel of inestimable value, worn by Louis XVI, whose discovery would bring him glory (this jewel is inspired by the blue diamond of the Crown). But there comes up from the depths a safe which turns out to contain only a drawing representing a naked girl wearing the pendant jewel. Thousands of miles away, an old lady, Rose Calvert, discovers this drawing on her television screen. She contacts Lovett and tells her that she is the girl in question. As one of the few survivors of the sinking of the Titanic still alive, she is taken on Lovett's crew boat and tells them about the ship's inaugural cruise, her sinking, and the love story she experienced with Jack Dawson, a third-class traveling artist.

            <Biography>James Francis Cameron was born on August 16, 1954 in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada. He moved to the United States in 1971. The son of an engineer, he majored in physics at California State University before switching to English, and eventually dropping out. He then drove a truck to support his screenwriting ambition. He landed his first professional film job as art director, miniature-set builder, and process-projection supervisor on Roger Corman's Les mercenaires de l'espace (1980) and had his first experience as a director with a two week stint on Piranha 2 - Les tueurs volants (1981) before being fired. In 1984, he wrote and directed Terminator (1984), a futuristic action-thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton. It was a huge success. After this came a string of successful science-fiction action films such as Aliens - Le retour (1986), Abyss (1989) and Terminator 2 - Le jugement dernier (1991). In 1990, Cameron formed his own production company, Lightstorm Entertainment. In 1997, he wrote and directed Titanic (1997), a romance epic about two young lovers from social classes who meet on board the famous ship. The movie went on to break all box office records and earned eleven Academy Awards. It became the highest grossing movie of all time. The rest is history.
