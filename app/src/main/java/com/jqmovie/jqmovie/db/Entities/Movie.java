During a miniature submarine dive, he hopes to finally get his hands on the Heart of the Ocean, a unique jewel of inestimable value, worn by Louis XVI, whose discovery would bring him glory (this jewel is inspired by the blue diamond of the Crown). But there comes up from the depths a safe which turns out to contain only a drawing representing a naked girl wearing the pendant jewel. Thousands of miles away, an old lady, Rose Calvert, discovers this drawing on her television screen. She contacts Lovett and tells her that she is the girl in question. As one of the few survivors of the sinking of the Titanic still alive, she is taken on Lovett's crew boat and tells them about the ship's inaugural cruise, her sinking, and the love story she experienced with Jack Dawson, a third-class traveling artist.", R.mipmap.titanic,1,1)) ;
